Welcome to my blog. My name is Mindaugas MozÅ«ras, and I'm a twentysomething software developer. Here I intend write about anything that interests me - mostly various development topics, but there will probably be some general geekery as well. If you want to get a sense of what I'm currently excited about, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/mmozuras) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mmozuras).

Why did I decide to blog? Is it because I think that I'm smarter? No. More knowledgeable? No. Shakespeare born-again? Certainly not.

It's because I'm not any of those things. But I want to become more skillful, knowledgeable and a better writer. And putting my thoughts out there might just help me achieve that.

I have already written a couple of drafts and I'll start publishing them as soon as I clean them up a bit. In the meantime, you can take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/mmozuras/mmozuras.github.com) of this blog. I used [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) to create it.

Thanks for your interest. See you soon.
