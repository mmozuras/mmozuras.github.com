I've been doing a lot of things this year that I was (and still am) afraid of doing. Writing a blog is one pretty obvious example. I wanted to try writing a blog for some time. So, what was stopping me? Fear of failure. Fear of putting my thoughts out there and getting a negative response. Asking myself "what's the worst thing that happen?" helped me overcome that.

    Fear is the mind-killer.
    Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.

Facing my fear, understanding it, put me halfway there. It's not a coincidence, that my blog is named "Coding Fearlessly". It's not named that way because I think of myself as fearless. It's named that way as a reminder. It reminds why I started this. It reminds me to have the same attitude every day. To do things. To not be afraid to make mistakes. To not be afraid to fail. To learn from my failures and move forward.

    I will face my fear.
    I will permit it to pass over me and through me.

If you want to do something, but you're afraid of doing it, it just might be worth doing. Fear is OK. Fear is good. In a lot of cases, it affirms that something is worth doing. Fear should be embraced, but not be the overruling factor.

    Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
    Only I will remain.

You can be comfortable, do what you've always done. It's fine, but not as good as the alternative. Face your fear. Stop wishing. Start doing.
