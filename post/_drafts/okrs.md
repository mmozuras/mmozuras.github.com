title: OKRs

I want to share you with you a couple of things I've learned about OKRs over the last year. We’ve had four iterations already! Time flies ✈️, doesn’t it? When we first introduced OKRs, I had doubts about the value they’ll bring. I was probably not the only one 😁. Today I see OKRs as a really handy tool if used well.

I didn’t initially know how to use OKRs well. Looking back at the first iteration of Engineering objectives and key results, I can boldly say “these are bad” 😬. Here are them from April:

> Establish technical leadership
> - Achieve tech leadership responsibility score of 5.5.
> - Define and agree on Engineering vision, strategy & prioritized roadmap.
> - Define and agree on Guilds visions, strategy & prioritized roadmaps. Work using these roadmaps during Guild Days and other available time.
> - Integrate QA/Mobile-Releases team into Engineering structure.
> - Integrate Global/Core team into Engineering structure.
>
> Close engineering gaps
> - Reduce monthly IT costs per active user from 0.06€ to less than 0.05€.
> - Reduce average weekly main backend service (core, Germany) response time from 138ms to 118ms.
> - Increase monthly crash-free session rate from 98.5% to 99.6%.
>
> Invest into engineering future
> - Increase development speed and prepare for other architecture improvements by splitting main backend service (core) and using API from Web.
> - Research, define and agree on Machine Learning usage vision/roadmap, and implement proof of concept.

Main problems that I see with these key results:

* some of them are not about result (what should we achieve?), but about process (how?).
* some of them are harder to measure, even if they are quantifiable (IT costs per active user, for example).
* some of them are not aligned with company goals.
* there are too many of them. Raise your hand, if you didn't even read of all them just now? ✋

For comparison, here are the latest Engineering objectives and key results:

> Become more cost-efficient with IT _to extend company runway_
> - Reduce monthly IT (hosting + services) costs from €127k to €100k
>
> Increase reliability and quality _to help grow business in Germany_
> - Enable 🇩🇪 TV campaign by ensuring no adjustments due to tech problems
> - Increase monthly uptime in KK from 99.4% to 99.9%
> - Increase Apple App Store KK rating from 3.5 to 4

Note that all of them are:
* result-oriented, easily measurable and aligned with higher company goals (extend company runway and help grow business in Germany).
* there’s only four key results! Now I’m able to recite my key results from memory! If you have a better memory, you can have more of them 🙃. Less is better. It gives clarity and focus.

There’s still one thing that I dislike/not-understand about OKRs: progress update. Did not provide any value for me so far. In my opinion, having just one number (confidence) would give more clarity.

Thanks to everyone who helped improve my OKRs. Especially @titas! He’s the one who asked to recite my key results from memory 🙂.
