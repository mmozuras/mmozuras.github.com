People say that you should read books like:

* From Zero to One
* Hard Thing about Hard Things
* Creativity Inc.

If you're in IT industry. Or if in a startup. That the knowledge gained from those books will transform you.

I had Creativity Inc. among my favorite books of 2015.

But I understand what it is. It's primarily not knowledge. It's entertainment/inspiration. There is some knowledge.  I don't expect to gain some insights that I'll use in my day to day. Those books are stories from people. What they did worked for them, but not work for you. It would be foolish to read "Steve Jobs" and then follow his steps to managing and working with people.


* The Power of Habit
* Good to Great
* Switch

That's the stuff that actually works.
