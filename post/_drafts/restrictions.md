I like getting stuff done. I also get distracted quite easily. Opening up _just_ one link from feedly or twitter can lead to an hour of unproductivity.

I try to solve that with control.

Quite easy on desktop. I don't use a lot of apps on my Mac. I have no Twitter client installed, for example. I use WasteNoTime extension on Safari (switched away from Chrome, because of battery life) to control how I spend my time. It allows to specify how many minutes per day I can spend on the wasteful websites. Works quite well.

It's harder on mobile. One thing I do - I don't have a lot of apps installed at all.

I am also careful with notifications. I try to limit the amount of them I receive.

I've struggled with Safari on mobile. I would often end up using it to open up distracting websites and spend time there. I thought that there was no solution. But co-worker helpfully pointed out existance of Restrictions. I ended up picking "Limit Adult Websites" option and adding distracting websites to the list.
