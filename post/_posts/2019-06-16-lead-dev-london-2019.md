On 11th and 12th of June, I attended [The Lead Developer London 2019 conference](//london2019.theleaddeveloper.com). This was my fourth time attending Lead Dev. I've also attended it in [2015](//2015.theleaddeveloper.com), [2016](//2016.theleaddeveloper.com) and [2017](//2017.theleaddeveloper.com). I went alone to the first Lead Dev ever in 2015. Every subsequent time I brought more and more co-workers from [Vinted Engineering](//engineering.vinted.com). The conference itself grew too. It's now in multiple countries around the world and welcomes multiple times more participants.

The things my co-workers and I learned over the years in Lead Dev have greatly influenced how we work and lead at Vinted. As one of us said this year - "it's the most useful conference I've ever attended". Lead Dev is also the conference that inspired the existence of [Vilnius Tech Leads](/vilnius-tech-leads-year-one).

I came to this year's conference in London without getting familiar with the schedule. I didn't have to. The conference is a two-day single-track event, and I trust the organizers with their curation skills. Even if I have never been able to get invited to speak myself. Not for lack of trying. The bar is high, and I hope to be someday able to clear it.

The videos from the conference will be uploaded in a couple of weeks, I recommend to check them out. In the meanwhile, I share some of my notes from the talks. I don't agree with everything I share here, but I found all of it interesting and compelling. Hopefully, they'll give you the sense of what Lead Dev is about and inspire you to visit also. Listed in chronological order.

- VCs, press and politicians might move on, but tools and techniques will stay
- AI: a field of science, attempts to understand how intelligence works and validates its hypotheses
- delegate decision-making to machines: AI provides methods that are pertinent to solving these problems
- agent-based engineering
- increasing self-direction: passive agent vs reactive agent vs proactive agent vs autonomous agent (generates goals based on its own motivations)

- traditional training, aversives: shame, fear, threats, reprimands, electric shocks
- positive training, incentives: rewards, praise, excitement, teamwork, mutual care and goals
- what causes a behaviour: goals + action + feedback
- clear goals: be clear with ourselves and others, personal goals aligned with company goals, respect others' goals

- the future is here... test it!

### [Steve Williams](//twitter.com/StickyWilliams), <i>A team in ten minutes</i>

- team of volunteers, [RNLI](//rnli.org), 2.5M pound boat
- do you ever have to 'respond to a crisis'?
- how to build the crews: identity, defined roles, cultural rituals, regular meetings, strong social element, shared experiences
- beyond training: exercising
  - the focus switches from acquiring skills to applying skills
  - exercises should be real-world scenario based. example: missing kayak group instead of "execute search pattern alpha"
  - likely outcomes: richer networks, resilience (due to the stronger network), preparedness for the real crisis, and maybe some novel solutions too
- [Dave Snowden model](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework): complex, chaotic, obvious, complicated

### [Melinda Seckington](//twitter.com/MSeckington), <i>Level up: developing developers</i>

- FutureLearn strategy: grow our own software engineers
    - as a manager, Melinda is responsible for internal developer experience
- 10 lessons of game design (not the same as gamification)
  1. don't overload new starters (new people have a lot to learn, onboarding checklist)
  2. support and guide new starters (provide a mentor)
  3. make it clear what people should focus on (personal development goals, tie in with bigger picture career goals)
  4. give people direct and timely feedback (encourage teammates to do it themselves)
    - [Thanks for the Feedback](//www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114120-thanks-for-the-feedback)

- create developer experience: take ideas from user/gaming experience

### [Bethan Vincent](//twitter.com/bethanvincent), <i>What I learn about hiring diverse teams from conducting a fully-anonymous recruitment process</i>

- learning from building an anonymous recruitment process:
  1. people want to showcase "soft" skills alongside "technical" ones
  2. jobseekers want human connection (the platform felt inhuman)
  3. lengthy tests and at home exercises are not inclusive
  4. your job listing is just as important as the application process
  5. if we really care about diversity and inclusion, we need to listen

### [Brian Scanlan](//twitter.com/brian_scanlan), <i>Volunteers, not conscripts: fixing out-of-hours on-call</i>

- on-call is terrific, a great way to grow and learn
- at the same time, on-call is terrible
- a virtual team of volunteers, who decide if they volunteer based on their situation
- outside of office hours, the on-call team gets all pages
- product teams are responsible for their stuff when they're in the office
- on-call for 1 week: Friday evening to Friday morning (UTC)
  - 6-7 engineers, 6 months until switching away from the team
  - there's also an on-call engineering leader (who engineers can escalate to)
  - remunerated for each on-call week
- lots of low-value paging alarms destroyed (low-value low-level symptoms instead of customer experience)
- accidentally built a global, diverse, engineer-led virtual team
- takeaways
  - challenge every part of your on-call setup
  - understand your customers and SLOs
  - optimise for people, humans > computers, [HumanOps](//www.humanops.com)
  - delete a lot of your alarms
  - continuously improving your on-call buys time and focus for your teams

### [Nickolas Means](//twitter.com/nmeans), <i>Eiffel's Tower</i>

- every organization is political
  - politics doesn't have to be bad
  - instead of a shit umbrella, the manager could be called a heat shield (block just enough)
- Eiffel had to do networking and self-promotion
  - a better way to call them - making friends and telling stories
  - Eiffel would tell about his previous work, show the final drawing of the future tower
  - Eiffel would also listen to their stories
  - telling stories (self-promotion): not in a braggy way, but in an informative way

  - build a representative pipeline
- steps
  - gathering information and getting the candidate excited about the job and the company
  - coding test: solve a simple problem and do a code review
  - interview: go through work history, gather evidence of them doing the job you defined
- scorecard to evaluate homework/code-review
   - ask specifically for evidence in the scorecard template
- blind code review - no one knows the name of the person who did the homework
- remember it's a two-way street, minimize the stress, care about candidate's experience

### [Miriam Busch](//twitter.com/miphoni), <i>Mobile development in 2019: native vs. cross-platform</i>

- iOS and Android developers are becoming more and more specialized, despite the cross-functional nature of the teams
- alternatives to native: React Native, Xamarin, Flutter
- platform specific problems disappeared after moving to a cross-platform solution, but it's not a free lunch
- you remove "do everything twice", but you're introducing additional complexity
- instead of supporting two platforms (iOS, Android), you hope to support one (React Native), but you actually support three
- it depends

At this point, I opened work Slack to check something. Instead of a quick open-and-close, I got distracted and engaged in a discussion about tech leadership and project management. Sadly, I missed the whole talk. Luckily, I will be able to watch all of it in a couple of weeks, when it's going to be uploaded.
