Office. Office never changes

Fog Creek waged war for [private workplace](http://officesnapshots.com/2009/01/08/fog-creek-software-office/) and marble showers. GitHub built an empire on letting everyone work wherever and whenever they want. 37signals reworked the whole industry by getting real.

But office never changes.

In the 21st century, most people were still working in open plan offices. Only this time, it wasn't done following [Taylorist principles](http://www.carusostjohn.com/media/artscouncil/history/taylorist/index.html), but instead for the higher calling of social engagement and closeness. For this reason, walls would be torn down, windows shattered and desks shared. Companies would dissolve into disruptive, stressful and cumbersome workplaces, bent on making employees feel like part of more relaxed venture.

A few were able to reach the relative safety of private offices and remote jobs. You are a part of that group. Safely behind the large door, in front of huge monitors, under LED light bulbs, live without knowledge of outside noise.

One day, an architect suggests a more creative place of work.

Your life is about to change.
