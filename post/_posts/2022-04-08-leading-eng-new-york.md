On April 8th, I attended [LeadingEng 2022 New York conference](//leaddev.com/leadingeng-new-york). This visit was my sixth time attending an event organized by [LeadDev](//leaddev.com/about-leaddev). My fifth one came earlier the same week, and I've written up [my notes for StaffPlus 2022 New York too](/staff-plus-new-york).

This event is the first LeadDev organized affair aimed strictly at Director/VP/CTO level technology leaders. The LeadDev series of events are aimed at any kind of engineering leader. Below I share my notes from the talks. I don't necessarily agree with everything, but I found all of it interesting. I hope it can give a sense of what LeadingEng is all about. My notes are listed below in chronological order.

------

### [Meri Williams](//twitter.com/Geek_Manager), <i>Career vectors - CTO flavors: Mixing & matching skillsets</i>

- Meri's journey: code, systems, architecture, processes, people, teams, systems of systems
- The jobs of technical leaders, and the skills of those leaders, will be good across different vectors:
  - hands-on, in-depth tech
  - tech strategy
  - delivery (getting stuff done)
  - organizational leadership & management
  - commercial understanding
  - domain depth
- Some, but not all, CTO archetypes:
  - Hands-on, deep technical expert - usually where deep technology IS the product
  - Outward-facing chief technologist - lots of investor relations
  - Architect type roles
  - Combo manager/leader roles - developing and enabling teams with a significant strategic component
  - Organizational leader - some places split this off in VP Engineering peer or report
- The proportion of "general executive" skill set tends to grow with company size & complexity
- Don't try to make everyone equally generalist - if you try, everyone will become just equally mediocre

### [Yvette Pasqua](//twitter.com/lolarobot), <i>Engineering leadership with a little help from my friends</i>

- Sustainable networking nurtures community, motivation, growth
- Growing your network can feel scary, but we should strive for sustainable and fulfilling
- Tactics to use:
  - Cold email, direct message, LinkedIn
  - Join groups
  - Connect 1:1 at events
- Framework:
  - Step1: what gives you energy? (love to do, doesn't seem like work, unique ability)
  - Step2: what are your networking options? (coffees, day-time get-togethers, tech meetups)
  - Step3: what problems to solve? (should combine with what gives you energy)

### [Charity Majors](//twitter.com/mipsytipsy), <i>Great engineers are made by great engineering teams</i>

- False: hire great engineers, and you'll create a great team
- [Accelerate](//goodreads.com/book/show/35747076-accelerate) provides a way to measure high performing teams
- When an engineer from a high performing team joins a medium or low performing team, their productivity tends to match the team they join
- A team of all senior engineers is a WEAK team
- A great team is made up of engineers who are ALL curious and motivated and challenged by their work

### [Krishna Kannan](//twitter.com/kkannan03), <i>Aligning teams through allocations</i>

- What happens when you do the wrong thing well?
- When struggling with customer impact, you should look at what you're doing:
  - Create a balanced plan
  - Work backward to understand the allocation
  - Track alignment frequently
- To make an impact: establish org-wide goals, build team-appropriate plans, reconcile those plans, adjust and align

### [Nivia Henry](//twitter.com/Lanooba), <i>Living in the future: How leading leaders is a lot like time travel</i>

- We have to operate at a different plane of time than our directs: weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually
- Managers of managers are typically at a quarterly/annual timeline
- Managing first-line leaders and senior leaders is different: for example, you have to provide context for business strategy multiple quarters ahead
- The components of a self-optimizing organization:
  - Effective: clear vision and mission, strong skillsets, feedback loops
  - Efficient: role clarity, alignment, speed
  - Enduring: health checks, fast recovery
- Seamless navigation: you need to have a view of how the organization is performing and what is happening in the organization
- Navigational tools: skills map for your team, org dashboard with key metrics

### [Lara Hogan](//twitter.com/lara_hogan), <i>Intentional influence</i>

- When we're trying to convince someone else, it's effortless if they speak the same language and care about the issue: that's rarely the case
- Long road: convince them to see your point of view
- Short road: see it from their point of view
- Influence is needed, no matter what title and formal authority you have
- Humans accidentally influence each other constantly: that's why this session is called <i>intentional</i> influence
- Identify stakeholders, understand whether they are a blocker, an ally, or a decision-maker
- Understand the needs of your stakeholders: belonging, improvement, choice, fairness, predictability, status
- Open questions can help understand the needs of your stakeholders
- Influence is about ideas and finding the right solutions (instead of describing problems): "Our current vacation is outdated" versus "A new vacation policy would help us attract more talent"
- A good tactic is to suggest an experiment, measuring the metrics that your stakeholders would care about

### [Jason Wong](//twitter.com/attackgecko), <i>The tools of culture change</i>

- Peter Drucker, 2006: "[Culture](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_culture) eats strategy for breakfast"
- [The book "The Changing Culture of a Factory"](//goodreads.com/book/show/3236396-the-changing-culture-of-a-factory) by Elliott Jaques was written in the 1950s
- Culture is defined by the behaviors we reward and punish
- [How We Recognize Engineers](//github.com/larahogan/ally-resources/blob/master/How%20We%20Recognize%20Engineers.pdf) by Lara Hogan
- Promotions are the key way to define culture in your organization
- [How to give effective feedback](https://blog.ed.ted.com/2017/11/09/how-to-give-effective-feedback-on-a-talk/)
- Deterrence theory: swiftness (how fast you'll get caught), certainty (how likely), severity
  - Research has shown that swiftness and certainty are way more important than severity

### [Swati Vauthrin](//twitter.com/suenacita1), <i>An Eng Leaders Intro on Understanding “the Business”</i>

- [EBIDTA](//investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp): Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization
- Revenue is the money generated from normal business operations; it's essentially how your company makes money
- Cost Center: a department or function within an organization that does not directly add to profit
- P&L (profits and loss): shows a company's revenue minus expenses for running the business
- Budget: an estimation of revenue and expenses over a specified future period
- [Imposter Syndrome](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) is sometimes worse when learning about "the Business"

### [Camille Fournier](//twitter.com/skamille), <i>Building aligned strategies</i>

- You're stuck in the middle between your team and people that want stuff from you
- Strategic communication: create understanding, drive agreement, build trust
  - Storytelling with SAR (Situation, Action, Result)
- Strategic execution: keep your org aligned and focused, identify problems early, develop leadership
  - Leadership meetings: heavily participatory, don't over-structure, not just your direct reports
  - Update meetings: scheduled, reporting on results, opportunity to shine
- Strategic planning: time-based (yearly down to quarterly), broad view with top-down elements, provides information to answer the "whys"
  - Good outputs require good inputs
  - Creates shared understanding: agreement on where we are, where we need to go, understanding of risks
  - Narrative objectives, measurable indicators: 3-5 objectives, 3-5 measures per objective
  - Inputs: current state of things (headcount, maintenance overhead, existing projects), variety of perspectives, a retrospective of what happened over the last cycle

### [Michael Winslow](//twitter.com/michaelswinslow), <i>Getting buy-in for your transformation strategy</i>

- Why a transformation is needed:
  - in response to a crisis
  - customer needs are changing
  - the technical landscape is changing
  - outpacing the competition
  - time-saving / operational efficiency
- Identify a strategy type:
  - compete: gaining an advantage over competitors
  - survive & thrive: gaining an advantage over a changing landscape
  - self disruption: gaining an advantage over our former selves
- Demonstrate due diligence:
  - Have other people attempted this change previously?
  - Have you incorporated learnings from previous attempts?
  - Are there champions you can recruit from these teams?
  - Have you identified the "network" you'll need to influence?
- Come up with our vision
- Distribution & the financials

### [Lee Matos Jr](//twitter.com/leematos), <i>Everyone can contribute: Make it so!</i>

- Have your Support Team contribute code
- Blockers:
  - Support teams don't have read-access to code
  - Support teams don't have write-access to docs
- Start with visibility/transparency/access
- Well-defined code review workflow is key ([InnerSourcing](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source))
- Product engineers focus on product, support engineers focus on bugs

### [Chad Carlson](//twitter.com/chadwcarlson), <i>Examples are hard: Prioritizing developer experience</i>

- [Platform.sh](//platform.sh) takes care of your infrastructure — from hosting and technology to global deployment and support - so you're free to explore new ideas

### [Laura Thomson](//twitter.com/lxt), <i>The places you'll go: how to keep learning in leadership</i>

- You need to "keep current," but you have no time to focus
- Why: make strategic technical decisions, know what to fund, maintain credibility, get a job, stay motivated
- Challenges: you don't know where to start or what to learn, you don't have time between meetings
- Sometimes, it's easier to learn a brand new thing than remember how to do things you used to know: relearning old skills can feel alien
- Learning new skills and becoming a generalist support systems thinking, and that's the job of a senior manager
- [Specialization is for insects](//en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Time_Enough_for_Love)
- How to learn: warm the cache, use your ears, train yourself to learn in sprints
- Tips: listen to people at work and what they are excited about, try learning about an area you know nothing about, embrace your dilettante

### [Maria Gutierrez](//twitter.com/mariagutierrez), <i>Healthy and effective leadership teams</i>

- Problems: misaligned priorities, duplication of work, a huge waste of effort, blocked from shipping, performance concerns, teams frustration
- [The Advantage by Patrick Lencioni](//goodreads.com/book/show/12975375-the-advantage) and [the summary of the organizational health model from the book](//de7pikzj4hvyk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/10141652/TheAdvantageModelandSummary.pdf)
- Your first team is the team of your peers: for a CTO, the peer executives are their first team
- The first team of engineering directors could include other R&D leaders (product, design)
- What gets in the way of a strong leadership team: visibility, time, access
- [Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni](//goodreads.com/book/show/21343.The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team)
- [Thanks for the Feedback by Douglas Stone & Sheila Heen](//goodreads.com/en/book/show/18114120)
- Cadence of meetings: daily check-in, weekly tactical, monthly strategic, quarterly off-site review

### [Phil Calçado](//twitter.com/pcalcado), <i>Don't try this at home. How to practice self-improvement as a senior leader</i>

- The higher in the org chart you are, the less time/patience/experience your own manager will have to coach you
- People hate being jerked around as leadership "learns more"
- First-level managers make sure the team's delivery machine works to the expectation
- Senior managers do whatever is needed in the current stage
- Figure out what your boss thinks you should be doing
- Think of your role as discrete parts
- Think of management books the same as design pattern books
- Favor internal peers for networking
- Technical skills become relevant again when you land in senior management roles
  - When you're a first-level manager, you're surrounded by technical people - that's not the case when you're a manager of managers
