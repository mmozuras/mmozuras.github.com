There's more focus in my life. It has not always been that way.

I'm laying in bed. My eyes are open. I hold Kindle with one hand, focused on resolute words. I get into flow and read for almost an hour.

I'm working on this blog post. My fingers swiftly move from one key to another. The coffee shop is half empty. I write for a long while without distractions.

I'm talking with my brother on my iPhone via video chat. We exchange stories, tell each other what happened during the week. Our attention are on each other. We talk and talk until there's nothing more to say.

It has not always been that way.

I used to get distracted. I would get on twitter, click a couple of links and an hour later a blog post would not be finished.

My attention would be stolen away. My phone would light up and play a sound. Whoosh. Chirp. Snikt.

I've eliminated
I don't have a lot of apps on my phone.
I don't follow a lot of people of twitter.
I limit various websites and FB feed. I use FB primarily as messenger and events thing.

my work would fall by the wayside.

A couple of weeks ago I've turned off notications for Outlook (email, calendar) and Slack on my iPhone. I've had them off for Messenger for a while.
