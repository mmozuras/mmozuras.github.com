I've started listening to podcasts sometime in 2007, almost 9 years ago. [DotNetRocks](//dotnetrocks.com/) was my first show. Can't remember whichever episode was the first one, but I distinctly remember listening to Billy Hollis talk about Complexity ([show #214, 2007-02-13](//dotnetrocks.com/?show=214)) and trying really really hard to keep up. Stopping and rewinding was not unusual.

Just like [@ailon](//twitter.com/ailon), whose [post](//medium.com/@ailon/podcasts-i-listen-to-2016-edition-8c50ec7e7831) inspired to write this one, I've been listening ever since. I spend a lot of time with podcasts - I listen when I walk, prepare and eat breakfast, in the shower, do chores and run. After DotNetRocks, my next two podcasts were [Hanselminutes](//hanselminutes.com/) and [Mondays](//mondays.pwop.com/). As I moved on from Microsoft ecosystem (and Mondays is no longer active), none of them are among my current subscriptions.

These days I devour podcasts on the iPhone, using [Overcast](//overcast.fm). It's a simple reliable podcast player with a couple of useful powerful features. The official iPhone Podcasts app had trouble dealing with the number of subscriptions I have and was constantly laggy. No such problems with Overcast.

The podcasts I listen to are listed below. They are divided into groups by the share of episodes I consume.

## All

I listen to all episodes of the podcasts here. Mostly because they are amazing.

* [Accidental Tech Podcast](//atp.fm/) - my favorite at the moment. One and a half year ago, during my vacation in Rome, I ran out of podcast episodes to listen to. I like [Marco Arment's writing](//marco.org/), which led me to Accidental Tech Podcast (he's one of the hosts). Probably got through 20 episodes during that vacation alone.

* [Under the Radar](//relay.fm/radar) has two hosts. One of them is "Underscore" David Smith. The other one... Marco.

* [The Ruby Rogues](//devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/) is _the_ podcast for Rubyists. And I do still write Ruby.

* [Dan Carlin's Hardcode History](//dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/) can require a ton of patience. Something like four episodes per year is not much. But each is 3-4 hours long, masterfully narrated and leaves wanting more at the end.

* [Common Sense with Dan Carlin](//dancarlin.com/common-sense-home-landing-page/) offers a unique perspective on social and political topics in captivating style.

* [Filmspotting](//filmspotting.net/). If you've read my [yearly summary](/2016/01/12/year-2015/), you know that I'm a bit of a cinephile.

* [Software Engineering Daily](//softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/podcast/) is the newest addition. Can't say much about it, but hope for it to earn a permanent place on this list.

## Most

I skip some episodes of these podcasts. Either after looking at episode title or deciding to stop in the middle.

* [The /Filmcast](//slashfilm.com/category/features/slashfilmcast/) is another podcast for cinephiles. I slightly prefer Filmspotting, because through it I discover movies I wouldn't otherwise. /Filmcast focuses more on the mainstream.

* [99% Invisible](//99percentinvisible.org/) is the first podcast I would recommend to a stranger. Most people will like it at least a little. Its goal is to expose the unseen and overlooked.

* [This Week in Startups](//thisweekinstartups.com/). I enjoy it less and less. New insights ran out and Jason Calacanis can be grating at times.

## Some

For one reason or another, I only manage to consume a small sample of new episodes from these.

* [Reconcilable Differences](//relay.fm/rd) is amazing, because [Siracusa](//twitter.com/siracusa) (co-host of Accidental Tech Podcast) and [Merlin Mann](//twitter.com/hotdogsladies) are amazing. It's not time sensitive, so I expect some day go through all episodes of Reconcilable Differences.

* [Back to Work](//5by5.tv/b2w) and [Freakonomics Radio](//freakonomics.com/category/freakonomics-radio/podcasts/) are great podcasts. There's simply not enough hours during the week.

* [a16z](//a16z.com/podcasts/). From my experience: bland, broad and boring.

* [Talking Machines](//thetalkingmachines.com/). I wish I _was capable_ of listening to this podcast about Machine Learning. Goes really deep and I (for my lack of knowledge) have trouble following the discussion.

* [JavaScript Jabber](//devchat.tv/js-jabber/). I don't do much JavaScript these days. Some topics are still interesting though.

* [The Incomparable](//theincomparable.com/theincomparable/) is all about the geeky media. Only listened to all their episodes about Star Wars (with Siracusa as a co-host) as a preparation for the latest movie. Worth it.

## None

* [The Bugle](//thebuglepodcast.com/) was a great comedy podcast. Not officially dead, but one of the hosts now has an exceptionally good [HBO show](//youtube.com/user/LastWeekTonight). Wouldn't hold my breath.

* [Giant Robots Smashing into other Giant Robots](//giantrobots.fm/) recently transitioned to a format I like less. Unsubscribed.

* [Rocket](//relay.fm/rocket), [The Nerdist](//nerdist.com/podcasts/nerdist-podcast-channel/) and [Song Exploder](//songexploder.net/) are all very entertaining, but there's a limit to how much entertainment I can consume each week.

* [Serial](//serialpodcast.org/). The first season was exceptional drama, I just don't expect to find the time to listen to the 2nd one. And if I'll have the time, I'll choose Reconcilable Differences instead.

That's it for mine. And what are you listening to?
