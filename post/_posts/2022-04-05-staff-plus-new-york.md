On April 5th, I attended [StaffPlus 2022 New York conference](//leaddev.com/staffplus-new-york). This was my fifth time attending an event organized by [LeadDev](//leaddev.com/about-leaddev). I've previously attended four of their conferences in London, including the first one ever. I'm happy to see they've continued to grow as a community and an event organizer.

I'm in New York for a different conference organized by LeadDev happening the same week - LeadingEng. I've visited StaffPlus because while it isn't directly aimed at me, I thought I'll still be able to receive a lot of value. And I did.

[On-demand access to all talks is available from April 12th, 2022](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-new-york/livestream-videos). In the meanwhile, I share my notes from the talks. I don't necessarily agree with everything I share here, but I found all of it exciting and compelling. Hopefully, they'll give you a sense of what StaffPlus is all about. My notes are listed below in chronological order.

### [Silvia Botros](//twitter.com/dbsmasher), <i>Being a principal engineer. The world is your oyster.</i>

- Traditional move for a long while was to go from senior engineer to a manager
  - Managers assumed that those who can do could also teach
  - Engineers assumed more decision-making power
  - People chose to go into management for the wrong reasons
- Enter "Staff+ Career ladders" for senior individual contributors
  - Technical leader: makes technical decisions and leads
  - Don't manage people, but participate with input in evaluating teams' performance
  - Translate product strategy to technical strategy and technical execution
  - Say "it depends" a lot, as there's a lot of ambiguity
- [Enterprise Principal Engineering Basics](//twitter.com/krisnova/status/1511009223282417675):
  - Just because you can doesn't mean you should.
  - How can I help?
  - What are the consequences of coupling these systems?
  - How will we interface with X if Y goes down?
  - Is this written down anywhere?
- Beware the stereotypes and actively work against them
  - ["The Ivory Tower"](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_tower), ["Bring the purple robes"](//tibia.fandom.com/wiki/Purple_Robe)
  - They exist from real scar tissue, don't dismiss them
  - You run the risk of losing touch with how the team works: be with the team and be involved

### [Ryan Harter](//twitter.com/harterrt) , <i>Strategies for focusing on the Most Important Thing</i>

- Bad defaults: prioritization by inertia, decibels or guilt
- The ritual: empty your inbox, reflect on the last week, <i>choose</i> your work
- The questions that help with the ritual:
  - What can you delegate?
  - How can you delegate more?
  - What should <i>you</i> be working on?
  - What "must" you do?
  - What feels urgent? Is It?
  - Who cares? What happens if I drop this?
  - How would you convince the CFO they can't afford to lose you?
  - What do you take home at the end of the week?
  - What would change everything?

### [Amy Unger](//twitter.com/cdwort), <i>Starting a new job as a Staff+</i>

- Seven key questions that help figure it out
- 1: Why were you hired?
  - Why was this position created at this level, and not a level below?
  - Who are you looking to fill this position externally?
  - "Nobody wanted this job"
- 2: How can I build my network?
  - Build organizational context, walk through the structure
  - Do 1:1s with ICs who report into your manager
  - Build team context and your peer network
- 3: What's your job?
  - [Will Larson's archetypes: tech lead, architect, solver, right hand](//staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes/)
  - Discuss how you're spending your time
  - Clarifying your manager's job can help you understand yours
  - What kind of work gets people promoted?
- 4: What (wrong) lessons did you learn?
- 5: What do you tackle first?
  - Work backward from your goals
  - Your manager's job will always be easier if you are more confident
- 6: What can you uniquely do as a new person?
  - As a new person, you have opportunities you won't have later
  - If it's unclear to you as a new joiner, it's likely unclear to someone more junior
- 7: When do you know <i>enough</i>?

### [Michelle Bu](//twitter.com/hazelcough), <i>Lifecycle of an API design</i>

- Write the quickstart guide: akin [to writing the press release](//productplan.com/glossary/working-backward-amazon-method/)
- Model the domain: [the heart of software is its ability to solve domain-related problems for its user](//goodreads.com/book/show/179133.Domain_Driven_Design)
- Package the model
- Test and iterate: build a lot of integrations, identify friction, and remove friction

### [Katie Sylor-Miller](//twitter.com/ksylor), <i>Moon to Mars: Planning and executing for the long term</i>

- Respect user preferences: the right thing to do might not be the most popular one

### [Scott Triglia](//twitter.com/scott_triglia), <i>Driving clarity in ambiguous projects</i>

- Ambiguous projects can be ambiguous for different reasons: unclear requirements, complex plans, complicated team dynamics
- Before the project begins
  - Resist poorly defined goals with a PRFAQ (product brief)
  - Be explicit about your customers and their specific needs
- Getting off the ground
  - All stakeholders are not built alike, be specific about the stakeholders (e.g., RACI)
  - Start building from a tight nucleus, keep the team small at the start
  - Warning sign: it takes months to finalize the perfect design
  - Spur discovery with mediocre proposals, but be explicit
- Turning the corner on execution
  - [Build, measure, learn](//theleanstartup.com/principles): execute against your plan, adjust when you learn new information
  - [Avoid the lake](//leaddev.com/agile-other-ways-working/avoid-lake)
  - Decisions should be first-class, logged, and broadcasted in public
  - [Consider using documents, not email](//rinaarts.com/this-email-should-have-been-a-document/)

  - If the project leader is panicking, everyone else will start panicking too
  - Allowing yourself to bend and adjust with pressure means you won't break

### [John Riviello](//twitter.com/JohnRiv), <i>The art & science of decision buy-in</i>

- How to decide, and who will decide?
  - There are many ways to decide: democracy, meritocracy, autocracy

  - Disagreement: one or both parties are likely to be wrong
- Conclusions from the [Harward Business Review study](//hbr.org/2018/12/the-right-way-to-use-the-wisdom-of-crowds):
  - Pre-commit to a strategy for combining their opinions
  - The person responsible for final judgment shouldn't form an opinion beforehand
  - Disagreement should be thought of as valuable information

### [David Daly](//twitter.com/DavidDaly44), <i>Leveraging your peers as a Staff Plus Engineer: Building peer groups</i>

- Keep it lightweight when starting to build a community of peers
- Get the scope right: both too few and too many people won't work
- Self-organize: the members of the group should run the group
- Provide value: the group should be serving the purposes of the members
