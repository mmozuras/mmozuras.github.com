    <p>My name is Mindaugas MozÅ«ras. I'm a <a href="//github.com/mmozuras">software developer</a>, <a href="//www.goodreads.com/user/show/36968510-mindaugas-moz-ras">book reader</a>, <a href="/talks">speaker</a>, <a href="//letterboxd.com/mmozuras/">movie lover</a> and an all around geek. Most of the time these days I spend doing my darned best to help make second hand the first choice worldwide as VP of Engineering at <a href="//engineering.vinted.com">Vinted</a>.</p>

    <p>When I'm not doing that, I contribute back to software development community. I've made significant contributions to open source with my own projects and improvements to existing ones. I'm also a frequent speaker at software development community events, sharing my personal experience and that of Vinted Engineering team.</p>
