This talk is about how we approach Engineering at Vinted. Sustainable speed is a crucial element of our approach.

Everyone values speed. Fast is better than slow. At Vinted, we value speed too. But we recognize the differences between short-term speed and long-term speed. Instead of a short-term burst, we want to be sustainably fast.

Presented at [Mobile One](//www.mobile.one) and [VilniusPHP](//vilniusphp.lt).
